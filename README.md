# Capstone Project: Budgeting App Command-Line Application

## Problem Statement

You are working as a software developer for a startup that is developing a budgeting app for college students. The app is intended to help students track their expenses, manage their budgets, and save money. As part of the development team, you have been tasked with creating a command-line application to perform some basic calculations for the app.

## Objectives

- Design and implement a command-line application using Dart that allows users to perform basic calculations related to budgeting and expenses.
- Utilize object-oriented programming concepts in Dart to structure the code.
- Demonstrate proficiency with control flow and functions in Dart.
- Use appropriate data types and variables in the application.
- Write clear and concise code with proper formatting and documentation.

## Submission Instructions

1. Create a repository on GitHub to host your project code.
2. Write a README file that describes your project and includes instructions for how to run the command-line application.
3. Include any necessary files, such as configuration or input files, in the repository.

## Requirements

- The application should take user input for two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).
- The application should perform the requested operation on the two numbers and display the result to the user.
- The application should handle division by zero and invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric characters).
- The application should allow the user to perform multiple calculations in a single session.
- The application should display a history of the previous calculations performed by the user.
- The application should include functionality to calculate percentages, average expenses, and savings rates.
- The application should use object-oriented programming concepts in Dart to structure the code.
- The application should use data types and variables appropriately in the application.
- The code should be clear, concise, and properly formatted with documentation.
